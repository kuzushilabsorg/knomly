I want you to focus on the following folder as well :
  "/Users/paruljuniwal/kuzushi_labs/self-hosted" and
  "/Users/paruljuniwal/kuzushi_labs/system-infra/self-hosted"
As we have done so far, we want to bring together a suite of internal tools for kuzushi labs:

  - zulip as replacement for slack

  - plane as replacement for Linear

  - docmost i think as replacement for notion/wiki

  - signoz for telemetry

  - twenty-crm as replacement for zoho/crm



  Additionally, we also have redis, postgres, mongo, livekit, qdrant and n8n deployed

  for internal usage in addition to other client facing tools with capabilities for

  text and voice interactions.



Think from first principles.

1. Think of a great name emerging from Kuzushi Labs + Anowmly

2. analyse ManusAI as well and see if this can be something similar.

3. We also have a PRD and product brief as below:



<Idea and High Level Brief>

AI Agent Team Platform

Your Personal AI Workforce — Conversational, Approachable, Operational

THE PROBLEM

The AI application layer is deeply fragmented. Solopreneurs, professionals, and small teams understand that powerful AI tools exist — voice agents, RAG chatbots, content generators, workflow automation — but face three critical barriers:

• Capability Gap: "I know AI can help, but I don't know what's possible or where to start."

• Operationalization Gap: Tools like n8n, Zapier, and CrewAI are powerful but intimidating for non-technical users.

• Fragmentation Gap: Using 5+ disconnected platforms to achieve what should be one cohesive workflow.



THE SOLUTION

A conversational platform where users talk to an AI team — joining a "meeting" with specialized AI colleagues who understand context, take briefs, and execute autonomously.

How It Works

1. Onboard via conversation: Tell the platform your goals. It suggests a "starter team" of 5-7 AI agents.

2. Daily standups with AI: Join a Google Meet-style call with your AI team. Brief them, assign tasks, review progress.

3. Agents execute using Kuzushi's toolkit: Zoice.AI for calls, WhatsApp bots for customer comms, content studio for marketing.

4. Human-like, not intimidating: Agents feel like colleagues — casual, personable (inspired by Shapes.Inc's social AI approach).

Is this feasible with our current self-hosted stack?

How do we connect all these different products tiogether through n8n and make an assistant for business ops and personal productivity using n8n?



Think from from principles, research and explore this




  Just do a tradeoff and brainstorming + system design session with me.

  Consdier the entire setup of frames:
  1. "https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat/blob/main/src/pipecat/frames/frames.py"
  2. "https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat/blob/main/src/pipecat/processors/frame_p
  rocessor.py"
  Can I repurpose/reuse this construct?
  I think you are already doing this.

  My requirment is simpler - it is driven by HTTP ideally but I want a pipeline type
  setup to basically be able to modularise and plug and play different providers,
  differnt data types and what we will do in our workflows and keep it extremely
  simple and yet flexible.

  Basically I love the pipeline setup that comes with pipecat which makes it so easy
  to swap out providers and different aspects in the same pipeline.
  What evenutally I want is this sort of set of provider integrations which can be
  plug and play with utmost ease:

  Today for this use case we have -> User -> Whatsapp -> Twilio Whatsapp -> webhook
  into FastAPI -> Transcription using Gemini -> message via API into Zulip -> return
  condimraiton to user

  Tomorrow, through this pipeline setup, we can easily swap out Transcription using
  Gemini to Transcription using Claude and message via API into Zulip as well
  message via API into Slack.

  So, basically, we also build out over time the set of integrations which pipecat
  has for different providers -> but we do it for different SAAS products and their
  APIs which also enriches the developer UX significantly.

  Also, let me know if there is already such integration built out by anyone out
  there.

  But the objective is to make this framework so so flexbile and easy to work where
  anyone can come and add their stuff.
  eg: pipecat now has all the conversational ai related services present in them
  :"https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat/tree/main/src/pipecat/services"

  ultrathink, review this requirement and assess pipecat code and what you have
  ijmplemented. Take it to a slightly higher level and focus on design principles
  and philosophy rather than implementing this directly. Do not delete/remove what
  you have done. We will build upon it. For now I need you to really really think
  and come up with a world class approach for this 

  Are you getting what I am saying?
